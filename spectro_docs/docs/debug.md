# Introduction to Debug Operations in Kubernetes

Kubernetes has many commands you can use to monitor and fine-tune your Kubernetes configuration. The following commands describe specific operations used to manage and debug your Kubernetes configuration:

* [*`kubectl get pods` command*](get_pods.md) - Display a list of all available pods and their status.

* [*`kubectl logs` command*](logs.md) - Display a list of all the log files for a specified pod.

* [*`kubectl exec` command*](exec.md) - Execute any commands that are installed on your pod.

These sections describe an overview of a few Kubernetes commands to manage your Kubernetes configuration. For information on all the Kubernetes commands available, including the [`debug`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#debug) command that offers an interactive debugging mode, refer to the [Kubernetes Getting Started Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#-strong-getting-started-strong-).
